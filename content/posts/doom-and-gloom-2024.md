# Game is rigged from the start
During my last year as undergrad, I stumbled upon a [guidebook](https://survivesjtu.gitbook.io/survivesjtumanual/) written by seniors who graduated at the same university. The [opening chapter](https://survivesjtu.gitbook.io/survivesjtumanual/li-zhi-pian/huan-ying-lai-dao-shang-hai-jiao-tong-da-xue) was grim, to say the least, I'll roughly translate the first paragraph.

>各位同学们，在本书的开始，我不得不遗憾地告诉大家一个消息。国内绝大部分大学的本科教学，不是濒临崩溃，而是早已崩溃。在此，我无意争论是否复旦、中科大、或者清华、北大是否比我们崩溃的更少一些——这种争论是没有意义的。我只是看到了无数充满求知欲、激情、与年轻梦想的同学们，将要把自己的四年青春，充满希望与信任地交给大学来塑造。这使我心中非常不安。

>To all, for the preface of this book, I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but it had to be said. Most undergraduate studies are not in the brink of collapse, on the contrary, it have already collapsed. Hence, there's no point talking about whether FDU, USTC, TsingHua or PKU has fallen further, such arguments are unproductive. I've just felt a great deal of unease, for the fact that countless ambitious, passionate and young students have full trust on the university to mould how'd their four years of irreversible youth.

I've barely went through the proper undergraduate student timeline, I've spent the first semester in campus, then the rest of the 2 and a half years out due to the travel restrictions, and barely gone through the final year completing the credits required before I got out. To be honest, I have not much sentiment towards my university alma mater, but with this book made me think of such grim thoughts put out by my authors.

Most of my peers are going to further their studies as masters or Phds, while the bad experience there further galvanized my decision to at least not pursue my postgraduates there and to start working as a software dev. 

# Thrusted into a world with minimal opportunities
Facing a backdrop of [local record high youth unemployment rates](https://www.statista.com/chart/30419/monthly-urban-youth-unemployment-rate-in-china/), I was to compete with not only the population, but to compete with the creame of the crop, at least competing with those who remain here. Having belief in one can achieve is one thing, but being grounded and assessing one's options is another. Call me lazy and unambitious, I was unwilling and hesitant to compete here for the meager roles available, plus I've lost my chances due to two aspects.
1. Most internationals who start job finding are probably postgraduates
2. Most students who found jobs have already started finding it since last year's fall semester

Plus, the [996 overworking culture](https://996.icu/#/en_US) here is notorious, and I don't really approve of such work etnic. Hence, I did what I believe was the rational thing, I came back and started to find a job back home. Previously, the tech industry, not only in the US of A, but China too, has been booming. Such might be one encouragement for graduates to stay and compete with others for the meager job openings and horrid working conditions. Though I've graduated to a backdrop of massive layoffs, an optimist might look at it and decide to stay.

Alas, I did not. This decision could in the end bite me back, but as of the time writing this I couldn't give one. 

# Doomscrolling and cursed with awareness and informed
Going on [socmed](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/socmed), when you are actively feeded content discussing the current tough times, not only in software dev-sphere, but other markets as well, compounded with negativity bias and algorithms recommending you more related doom and gloom, it really sucks the life out of you.

Jobs, far and few, if not toiling. Irks me on the case that 6 working days a week work schedules and those alternating between 5 and 6 working days a week are on the rise here, contrary to my initial belief that it is only in other countries. Fact is, current state of affairs would lead me to take any job offer on the table, no matter how bad the work culture is. Beggars can't be choosers and I'm grateful that I don't need to toil under such conditions. 

As venture funds start to run out, newcomers to the industry will be distraught to learn that the market 3 years prior was the exception rather than the rule. Not only that, with companies "optimizing" (hate to use this term) to pre-pandemic times, the booming of LLM tools for developer productivity also spurts thoughts of doom and gloom into not only newcomers but old players. I claim not to be a clairvoyant(but don't we all wish we are), I'm just here to do my part.

Whatever happens, happens.
